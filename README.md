## LocateHer
LocateHer is a social networking platform that helps women connect to mentors in their area, as well as professional opportunities and events. Users sign up as mentors or mentees, can view other active users in their geolocated area, and offer to be a mentor or request to be mentored. 

## Background
The idea for this app was developed as a part of the [Women Founders Hack](https://womenfoundershack.foundersofthefuture.co/) 2018, organised by Founders of the Future. It was a 48 hour hackathon to tackle gender diversity in tech. With over 200 participants from diverse backgrounds, we formed groups to propose business ideas to be judged by a panel. 

The team which I joined initially described their idea as an "Uber for mentors" - in the sense of being able to geolocate a casual networking opportunity. I was interested to try implementing geolocation and Google Maps API toward building this app. As technical lead of the team, over 48 hours, I was able to build a functioning demo of the platform that included an events page, a blog, and the ability to view other users positioned on a dynamically updating map. Other features have been left visible but not interactive, as this is primarily a demo.

It was interesting to develop this project as a part of a team which also focused on marketing, business development, and business strategy. I was in charge of designing and bringing the product to life, but the attention to detail in planning around the product and envisioning its potential was very eye-opening to be a part of.
